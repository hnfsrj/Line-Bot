## Line Bot

Pygame simulation for line following robots using a single color sensor

## How to setup

Create a new virtual environment and use pip to install the requirements inside requirements.txt, and then run Simulator.py

## How to use

- Use your mouse to left-click and draw a path on the canvas (make sure it's close to a loop and not an S or other crazy shapes since it isn't supported by this version)

- And then click left_ctrl to switch you input mode to bots. Which means that you can now click to spawn the bots.
- Spawn bots on the path and since they are always spawened facing up, spawn them at the right or left most part of your path
